Context-awareness is an important issue in todays IoT world. Our project proposes a trigger that is activated based on the distance to a given object. In our scenario, we make us of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard which allows the distance measurement between two objects. We use a BLE beacon together with the Bluetooth sensor of the smartphone in order to measure the distance.

%	INTRODUCTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Introduction}
The main idea of this project is to build an Android app that allows to trigger IoT devices based on position / distance thereby adding context-awareness. One standard way to do this, e.g. employed by IFTTT, is the use of GPS or the connectivity of WiFi networks. Both of these technologies allow for great radius but are quite limited in their accuracy. Thus, we propose to use Bluetooth Low Energy to estimate the distance. This is done by using a beacon that continously sends out a broadcast signal using Bluetooth. This signal is then received by a sensor which estimates the distance based on the signal strength. In our scenario we make us of a RaspberryPi as beacon and API. The sensor is then provided by an Android phone.


\section{Practical Applicability of the Project}
This type of project can be used in numerous scenarios. A few of which are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
	\begin{description}
	\item[Automatically Unlocking a door] Our prototype can be used to automatically unlock the front door of a house once the inhabitant arrives and thereby replacing the normal key. In contrast to WIFI the accuracy of BLE is high enough to \emph{only} keep the door unlocked while standing right next to it.
	\end{description}
	\item 
	\begin{description}
	\item[Switching Appliances] Another use case would be switching on and off appliances based on ones position in the room. One example would be a desk lamp which is switched on once the user is sitting at a desk and it is dark outside.
	\end{description}
	\item
	\begin{description}
	\item[Sensor for SmartHome Applications] Another use case is the use as a sensor for SmartHome Applications and thereby adding a wide range of possibilities. It is for example possible to switch on the light, adjust the room temperature and turn on music once a person enters a specific room.
	\end{description}
	\item
	\begin{description}
	\item[Preventing misuse of devices] Another option would be to prevent the misuse of devices by only allowing the invocation of a command when the person is in a specific location. This could be used by AirBnB to prevent guests from unlocking the front door when they are not there or by companies to enforce security policies.
	\end{description}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conceptual Approach \& Architecture}


Our project architecture can be seen in figure \ref{fig:projectarchitecturefinal}. 

The used sensor is the Bluetooth sensor of an Android Smartphone. The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacon is sending its signal constantly and periodically. The Smartphone (hold by a human) comes closer to the Beacon and detects the beacon. As soon as the beacon is detected by the smartphone (by the human), it sends (the human automatically sends) a HTTP request to our webserver to open the door/ to turn on the light.\\

We simulated the Beacon furthermore by a node.js application on PC. Thus, debugging and testing was faster and possible on every machine.\\

The HTTP request arrives on the webserver (a Raspberry Pi). The Rasberry Pi handles the request by activating the lamp or opening a lock via its GPIO.\\

The Raspberry can be reached over a public IP adress. We used Balena as deployment architecture for the Raspberry Pi. Balena \cite{balena} is a IoT cloud deployment platform where Balena images can be downloaded and flashed on the Raspberry. The image auto-pulls the code which the developer pushs on his git repository. On Balena, the Raspberry Pi gets a public IP adress. We installed Localtunnel \cite{localtunnel} on the Raspberry Pi to resolve the IP adress to a DNS name and have a nicer server name.

\section{Sensors Used}
We used mainly the Bluetooth sensor of the Android phone in order to detect the BLE beacon. Furthermore the WiFi card of the phone and Raspberry Pi were to used for communication. The GPIOs of the RaspberryPi are used for the action itself.


\section{Problems Faced}
During the project we faced various issues. Most of these were due to a lack of experience especially in terms of Android, since we both had almost zero Android experience.

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
	\begin{description}
	\item[Use of BLE Android Library] The first challenge was to find an adequate Bluetooth Library for Android, which supports the Eddystone Beacon simulated by the RaspberryPi, as well as the iBeacon provided by the chair. Once the library was selected it took quite a long time to get it working. One of the issues here were the missing errors when required Android permissions were not set. 
	\end{description}
	\item 
	\begin{description}
	\item[Background Detection on Android 8+] Prior to Android 8 it was possible to keep a service running in the background in order to detect beacons when the application is in the background. Starting with Android 8 this is not possible any more \cite{young_2017} since services are limited to running only once every 15 minutes. As a solution a new API is provided which wakes up a given application once a defined beacon is in range. Unfortunately this did not work for us, thus we were forced to keep our application permantly active by creating a persistent notification.
	\end{description}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Work Items}
Building our prototype involved various work items which we completed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
	\begin{description}
	\item[Creating BLE Beacon] Creating a NodeJS application which serves as a BLE beacon both on the laptop and the RaspberryPi.
	\end{description}
\item 
	\begin{description}
	\item[Deployment to RaspberryPi] In order to have an easy way to deploy new versions of our application we decided to use Balena. Balena allows to run docker images on a RaspberryPi and manages the deployment.
	\end{description}
	\item 
	\begin{description}
		\item[Finding BLE Library for Android] Finding a BLE Library for Android which supports both the Eddystone beacon (RaspberryPi) and the iBeacon by the university.
	\end{description}
	\item 
	\begin{description}
		\item[Foreground Detection] Enabling the Android Application to find the beacon and then estimating the distance while being in the foreground.
	\end{description}
	\item 
	\begin{description}
		\item[Background Dectection] Enabling the Android Application to find the beacon while being in the background. In order to do this we needed to create an additional Application class which can permantly run.
	\end{description}
	\item 
		\begin{description}
		\item[RaspberyPi API] Creating an API on the RaspberryPi which interacts with the GPIOs.
	\end{description}
	\item 
		\begin{description}
		\item[Making API Requests with Android] Adding the API Request on the Android phone once the phone is near enough.
	\end{description}
		\item 
		\begin{description}
		\item[Publishing RaspberryPi API] In order to be indepent of the network setup the RaspberryPi publishes the API using a URL with localtunnel.me. Thus independently of a local network connection the API can be reached over the Internet.
	\end{description}
	\item
	\begin{description}
		\item[Testing] We used the feature branch system of Git: implementing and pushing, the other tests and merges into main branch.
	\end{description}
\end{enumerate}
